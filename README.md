========

A cli to automatically set all your Gemfile dependancies to your current version.

In short
--------

* Updates your Gemfile with your actual used version (from the Gemfile.lock)
* Set if you want to constraint the exact version (ex: = 4.3.2), the patch level (ex: ~> 1.2.3) or the minor level (ex: 1.2).
* Run a check on your Gemfile to ensure all your deps are properly constrained.
* No deps except bundler.

Cli
-----
```bash
Usage: breezer DIR [options]
    -l, --level LEVEL                Set the minimum level of gem updates (default: patch). Set to 'exact' to lock gems versions (not recommended).
    -L, --lockfile NAME              Use different lockfile (default: Gemfile.lock)
    -d, --dry-run                    Print the updated Gemfile instead of writing it
    -o, --output FILE                The output file (default: Gemfile)
    -c, --check                      Check that all gems have version constraints
    -h, --help                       Show this help message
